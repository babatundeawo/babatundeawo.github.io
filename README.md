### üî≠ My Research Focus

My primary research interest lies in **developing advanced solar radiation models** for ecological and climate impact studies, especially in tropical regions where data is often scarce. Accurate estimation of solar radiation is fundamental for climate prediction, renewable energy applications, and assessing ecological impacts on carbon sequestration, vegetation growth, and hydrological cycles.

**My research interests include:**
-   Atmospheric Radiative Transfer and Energy Balance
-   Aerosol‚ÄìCloud‚ÄìRadiation Interactions
-   Atmospheric Remote Sensing and Data Assimilation
-   Climate Forcing of Greenhouse Gases and Short-Lived Species
-   Renewable Energy‚ÄìClimate Nexus & Geo-spatial Climate Solutions

### üî¨ Featured Research: Parametric Estimation of Direct Irradiance

My Master's thesis, published in the *Bulletin of the Science Association of Nigeria* (2020), tackled the critical challenge of solar radiation data scarcity in West Africa.

-   **Objective**: Develop an efficient, easy-to-use method for estimating all-sky solar radiation using publicly available satellite data from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer).
-   **Methodology**: I incorporated the high-performance **Yang Model** with a cloud transmittance algorithm. I used Ferret NOAA and MATLAB to develop computational models and process MODIS satellite data for atmospheric parameters like cloud fraction, aerosol properties, and ozone amount.
-   **Key Findings**: The model demonstrated **significantly better performance** than NASA's Surface Meteorology and Solar Energy (SSE) products, which are often used for gap-filling. Our MODIS-based estimates showed lower Root Mean Squared Difference (RMSD) values across annual, rainy, and dry seasons (19.7%, 22.4%, and 21.2% respectively) compared to NASA SSE (31.5%, 27.5%, and 33.9%). This work provides a reliable alternative for climate and land surface process modeling where ground measurements are unavailable. The study also highlighted the damping effect of cloud fraction and aerosol absorption on solar irradiance.
